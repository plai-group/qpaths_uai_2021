## q-Paths: Generalizing the Geometric Annealing Path using Power Means

This is the code accompanying [q-Paths: Generalizing the Geometric Annealing Path using Power Means](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00745). Code for the ais experiments is available in `qpaths_uai_2021/ais/`, and code for smc experiments in `qpaths_uai_2021/smc/`, with run instructions contained within each folder. Code for all visualizations is available in `qpaths_uai_2021/visualizations/`.

q-path helper functions to be used across projects are available [here](https://github.com/vmasrani/qpaths_uai_2021/blob/main/smc/src/qhelpers.py).
